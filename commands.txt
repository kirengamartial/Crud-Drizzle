commands to connect to remote machine and building docker in it 

//  Run this command, if necessary, to ensure your key is not publicly viewable ".pem key"
chmod 400 "drizzy-1.pem"

// Connect to your instance using its Public DNS:
ssh -i "drizzy-1.pem" ec2-user@ec2-13-60-187-134.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com

// this will simply ensure that all essential packages on that remote machine are updated and are using their latest version
 sudo yum update -y or sudo dnf update -y

 // this allows us to install docker on our remote machine 
 sudo dnf install -y docker

 // this allows us to start docker on our remote machine
 sudo service docker start

 ***// sudo allows us the command to be executed as root user with sufficient permission


 // when you are not using ssh to interact with your instance you have to configure the security group on aws to use it
